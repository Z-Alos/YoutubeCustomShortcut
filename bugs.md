## YOUTUBECUSTOMSHORTCUT

@ Loads video/shorts if enter is pressed because of the selectableElement(currentIndex) -           partially fixed in youtube.comm/watch but not fool proof

@ Extension keeps on working even if you type in the search bar of youtube

@ Glide features partially works on the watch page even that thing is not intended
